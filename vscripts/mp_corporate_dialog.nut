	Grunt_1	Damn terrorists are trying to turn our own Spectres against us	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR901_01
	Grunt_2	I’m more worried about these metal bastards replacing us!	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR901_02
	Grunt_1	There’s gotta be thousands of Spectres stored here	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR902_01
	Grunt_2	Let’s just make sure we activate them before the enemy does	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR902_02
	Grunt_1	Why the hell are the Militia stealing our Spectres anyway?	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR903_01
	Grunt_2	They’re running on fumes…they need more men but there’s only so many colonists they can recruit. 	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR903_02
	Grunt_1	Spectres ain’t so great. I hear Hammond’s son was working on something bigger	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR904_01
	Grunt_2	What, like smarter drones?	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR904_02
	Grunt_1	Nah some kind of synthetic biology work…next-gen shit	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR904_03
	Grunt_1	Why aren’t we deploying those new titans in the field?	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR905_01
	Grunt_2	Advanced prototypes, not stable enough for combat duty.	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR905_02
	Grunt_1	Last time I looked half our platoon was Spectres	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR906_01
	Grunt_2	They’re good at following orders, what do you expect?	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR906_02
	Grunt_1	I used to serve on Harmony with a whole platoon of Mark II’s. Things creeped me out. 	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR907_01
	Grunt_1	Graves wants to activate every single one of these things to take out the militia for good.	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR908_01
	Grunt_2	Yeah, well not if the terrorists activate them first.	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR908_02
	Grunt_1	I saw a malfunctioning Spectre strangle a guy with one hand. Took four guys to pull him off.	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR909_01
	Grunt_2	Old software on the Mark II’s . I hear they patched that bug.	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR909_02
	Grunt_1	I'm glad these spectres are on our side	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR910_01
	Grunt_2	Don’t forget the Terrorists can turn them with a data knife	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR910_02
	Grunt_1	Why would they build such sophisticated machines with a port that can easily be hacked?	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR911_01
	Grunt_2	Its to update their combat systems on the fly	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR911_02
	Grunt_1	Ohhh	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR911_03
	Grunt_2	Sometimes spectres need to be rebooted as well	diag_imc_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR911_04

	// MILITIA

	Grunt_1	Suicide drones aren’t too smart, but they’ll leave a mark if you get too close	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR901_01
	Grunt_2	Apparently you can shoot them to keep ‘em from going super-nova	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR901_02
	Grunt_1	Never seen so many damn Spectres in one place.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR902_01
	Grunt_2	Let’s just hope the IMC doesn’t get to wake them up	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR902_02
	Grunt_1	So who’s this Hammond guy anyway?	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR903_01
	Grunt_2	Man, don’t you read? Guy built the first Titan chassis…among like a million other things. He died years ago… now the whole place is owned by the IMC.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR903_02
	Grunt_1	Rumor is, Hammond was trying to figure out artificial humans. You know, like Spectres that can think?	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR904_01
	Grunt_2	Yeah, right. How’d that work out for him?	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR904_02
	Grunt_1	All I’m saying is we should get some intel while we’re here. See what they’re up to.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR904_03
	Grunt_1	What the hell were those flying Titans about? I didn’t know they could jump so high.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR905_01
	Grunt_2	Some advanced prototype. IMC always has the latest toys. Guess that’s why we’re trying to blow this place up. Even the playing field.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR905_02
	Grunt_1	All those sleeping Spectres freak me out.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR906_01
	Grunt_2	Yeah, well, If all goes according to plan, Bish will have them blowing themselves up in order to level this place for good.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR906_02
	Grunt_1	Brother used to work here, before it got taken over by the IMC. Working with Vektor now up at the F.O.B. 	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR907_01
	Grunt_1	IMC is pissed we stole their Spectres, now they’re trying to activate every unholy robot here to wipe us out.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR908_01
	Grunt_2	Yeah, but not if Bish activates them first.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR908_02
	Grunt_1	I saw a Spectre punch a guy through the chest once.	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR909_01
	Grunt_2	Things creep me out. I don’t even want them fighting for us	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR909_02
	Grunt_1	These spectres are tough to kill	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR910_01
	Grunt_2	Yeah, I guess that’s why Pilots just turn them	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR910_02
	Grunt_1	Man, I wish I had one of those data-knifes they issue to Pilots	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR911_01
	Grunt_2	Do you even know how to work one?	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR911_02
	Grunt_1	Yeah, you just stick it in and magic...right?	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR911_03
	Grunt_2	I don't think its that simple, plus those knives cost a fortune	diag_mcor_grunt1_gs_corpcommment_CR911_04
